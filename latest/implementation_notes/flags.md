Scoring applications may create groups of flags for notes shorter than
16th notes (semiquavers) by combining **flag16thUp** with the required
number of **flagInternalUp** for stem up notes, or **flag16thDown** with the
required number of **flagInternalDown** for stem down notes, stacking
**flagInternalUp** above or **flagInternalDown** below respectively, ensuring
even spacing.

The set of stylistic alternates for shorter flags may be substituted by
a scoring application in the case of a dotted note with an upward stem,
to avoid collisions between the augmentation dot and the flag.
