These symbols are designed to combine with accidental symbols
(**accidentalSharp** and **accidentalFlat**) from the music font and the letters
A–G (for root and bass alterations), lower case letters (for chord
qualities, e.g. “maj” and “min”) and numbers (for chord extensions or
tensions) from any standard text font to produce complete chord symbols.

Scoring applications should be able to create strings with complex
formatting, e.g. superscript and subscript characters, small digits
stacked on top of each other, and scale these symbols to any arbitrary
size in order to produce satisfactory chord symbols with a wide variety
of visual appearances.
