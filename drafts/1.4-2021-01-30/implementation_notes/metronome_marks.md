This range is most useful in fonts intended for text-based applications,
with metrics that are compatible for mixing musical symbols with text.
These precomposed notes may be used for displaying metronome marks and
simple metric modulations. More complex metric modulations and
*lâ€™istesso tempo* directions may be drawn using these characters in
conjunction with the **Beamed groups of notes** range.

It is recommended that the default stem length for characters in this
range is reduced by 0.75 spaces from the normal minimum of 3.5 spaces.
This helps to balance the notehead and its stem and flag with the
surrounding text.

By contrast, the characters in the **Individual notes** range are
intended for positioning on a staff, and hence have the default minimum
stem length of 3.5 spaces.
