Sagittal diacritics are placed to the left of Sagittal accidentals if
required; at most one diacritic from each group. If there are multiple
diacritics, those representing the larger alteration are placed closer
to the accidental. If diacritics are directly altering the natural note,
they should be placed to the left of, but not touching, one of the
bare-shaft glyphs (**accSagittalShaftUp** or **accSagittalShaftDown**);
whichever one represents the direction of the sum of the diacritic
alterations.
