Version 1.19 (2015-08-07):

-   Corrected implementation notes to clarify how brace glyphs should be
    handled by consuming applications: rather than scaling them only in
    the vertical dimension to fit the height of the staves being braced,
    they should be scaled proportionally.

Version 1.18 (2015-05-18):

-   Added specification of locations for font-specific metadata to be
    installed on Windows, OS X, and Linux, to aid consuming applications
    in the identification of SMuFL-compliant fonts.

-   Added recommendation that characters in ranges that will typically
    be drawn using runs of text (e.g. time signature digits, octave line
    labels, figured bass, and function theory symbols) should have
    appropriate non-zero side bearings.

-   Reworked the triangular clefs in the **Clefs** range between U+E06F
    and U+E072 to match the descriptions given of their use by Schäffer
    in Karkoschka’s book. This involved changing the names and
    descriptions of these glyphs as follows: U+E06F was cClefTriangular,
    now schaefferClef; U+E070 was fClefTriangular, now
    schaefferPreviousClef; U+E071 was cClefTriangularToFClef, now
    schaefferGClefToFClef; U+E072 was fClefTriangularToCClef,
    now schaefferFClefToGClef.

    noteHalfEmpty, and noteBlackEmpty in the **Note name
    noteheads** range.

-   Added new **Metronome marks** range, with stem up and stem down
    notes intended to be proportioned for setting in line with
    characters from a regular text font; specifically, it is recommended
    that stems are shortened by 0.75 spaces from their default length.

-   Clarified role of **Individual notes** range, which is that notes in
    this range are intended for drawing on a stave, and as such should
    have the default stem length (3.5 spaces minimum).

-   Added baseline and superscript italic *a*, *b*, *m*, and *v*
    characters to the **Octaves supplement** range, to allow the
    creation of arbitrary octave line markers beyond those included in
    the **Octaves** range.

-   Added marcato-tenuto above/below composites to the
    **Articulation** range.

-   Added alternative “raised 6” character to the **Figured
    bass** range.

Version 1.12 (2015-01-07):

-   Added specification of new noteheadOrigin anchor points for the
    glyphsWithAnchors structure to help with the correct alignment of
    noteheads that have left-hand side bearings with those that do not.

-   Added specification of new opticalCenter anchor points for the
    glyphsWithAnchors structure to help with the correct balancing of
    glyphs that should be centered on noteheads and stems (e.g.
    dynamics)

-   Added new **Time signatures supplement** range, with square brackets
    for the whole time signature and numerator only, the slash separator
    sometimes used for interchangeable time signatures, and new
    timeSig2Cut glyph, used by Bach and other composers of that period
    as an alternative to the normal cut common (*alla breve*) symbol.

-   Added new **Octaves supplement** range, with *loco*
    text (octaveLoco). Revised the existing **Octaves** range,
    correcting the recommended appearance of the *ottava bassa*,
    *quindicesima bassa*, and *ventiduesima bassa* glyphs, and adding
    new glyphs for commonly-used but incorrect abbreviations for
    these glyphs.

-   Added missing stem down noteheads for smnSharp and smnSharpWhite in
    the **Simplified Music Notation** range.

-   Added Salzedo’s symbols for ascending and descending Aeolian chords
    to the **Harp techniques** range.

    the **Analytics** range.

Version 1.0 (2014-06-16):

-   Now that SMuFL has reached 1.0, the code points and glyph names for
    all current glyphs will not change in future revisions.

-   Added specification for new splitStemUpSE, splitStemUpSW,
    splitStemDownNW and splitStemDownNE anchors in font-specific
    metadata to define stem connection points for altered unisons.

-   Added punctum deminutum (chantPunctumDeminutum) glyph to **Medieval
    and Renaissance plainchant single-note forms** range.

Version 0.99 (2014-06-02):

-   Modified the specification of the glyphsWithBBoxes structure in the
    font-specific JSON metadata such that the glyph’s name is the
    primary key, rather than the value of a name key, which makes it
    easier to consume this data.

-   Added an optional description key to the sets structure in the
    font-specific JSON metadata, to contain a human-readable description
    of a stylistic set.

-   Added a new fourth value to the type key for the sets structure, for
    large time signature digits intended for drawing outside the staff.

-   Added specification of new graceNoteSlashSW, graceNoteSlashNE,
    graceNoteSlashNW and graceNoteSlashSE anchor points for the
    glyphsWithAnchors structure to help with the correct positioning of
    slashes on stem up and stem down flags of unbeamed grace notes.

-   Added specification of new repeatOffset anchor point for the
    glyphsWithAnchors structure to help with the correct registration of
    tessellating glyphs.

-   Added clarifications in the glyph registration guidelines for fonts
    intended for use in scoring applications that parentheses glyphs may
    have negative side bearings to improve default kerning of these
    glyphs with the symbols they are intended to bracket; likewise,
    tessellating glyphs (such as the wiggle that follows the  symbol)
    may have negative side bearings to produce correct tessellation when
    set in a single run of text.

-   Added 8 and 15 digits scaled correctly for positioning on G and
    F clefs.

-   Added recommended stylistic alternates for common time, cut time
    and + intended for use as large time signatures printed above
    the staff.

-   Added a set of noteheads enclosed in large circles, used by
    some drummers.

-   Added an ornate X notehead contained within an ellipse.

-   Added Couperin’s *pincé* and *tremblement appuyé* ornaments.

-   Redesigned the thumb position string technique glyph to more closely
    resemble a zero digit, and added a turned version.

-   Added a zero-width rectangle intended to enclose single percussion
    beaters inside a box.

-   Added strum direction arrows for guitar, and a stylistic alternate
    for the golpe glyph as used by Antonis Vounelakos.

-   Added an additional raised 7 digit for figured bass.

-   Added left- and right-pointing arrows for use in metric modulations.

-   Added recommended ligatures for combining Johnston accidentals with
    standard sharp and flat accidentals.

-   Removed the ranges of glyphs for wind instrument fingering charts.

Version 0.9 (2014-04-17):

-   Expanded the specification of font-specific metadata to include new
    structures to describe stylistic alternates, stylistic sets and
    ligatures present in fonts for applications that cannot access
    advanced font features.

-   Defined new values for the “glyphs” structure in font-specific
    metadata to describe cut-outs from the four corners of a glyph’s
    bounding box, in order to allow better kerning or interlocking of
    glyphs in some circumstances, e.g. when stacking accidentals; also
    renamed this structure to “glyphsWithAnchors” to clarify
    its purpose.

-   Defined specification for new ranges.json file, which provides
    information about the ranges of glyphs described in this
    specification in a machine-readable fashion.

    plainchant single-note forms** range, and moved *punctum auctum
    inclinatum* and *punctum auctum diminutum* to this range.

-   Added *strophicus liquescens* (for intervals of a second up to
    a fifth) to the **Medieval and Renaissance plainchant multiple-note
    forms** range.

-   Added oblique ligature forms for mensural notes describing intervals

Version 0.8 (2014-02-03):

-   Based on community feedback, added clarification that code points
    for glyphs may change until SMuFL reaches version 1.0, after which
    point existing code points will become immutable.

-   Glyphs in SMuFL encoded in the primary range of U+E000–U+F3FF are no
    longer considered “mandatory”, but rather they are “recommended”: in
    order to be considered SMuFL-compliant, a font need not implement
    every recommended glyph, just as a text font need not implement
    every Unicode code point in order to be
    considered Unicode-compliant. Fonts need only implement those glyphs
    that are appropriate for their intended use at the correct SMuFL
    code points in order to be considered SMuFL-compliant.

-   Changed guidelines for metrics of text-like glyphs (e.g.
    dynamics, D.C./D.S. markings in repeats) in fonts intended for use
    in scoring applications, such that it is recommended that the
    x-height of such glyphs is around 1 staff space (0.25 em).

    three-rank accordions, and accordion ricochet glyphs.

Version 0.7 (2013-11-27):

-   Introduced canonical names for every recommended glyph, which are
    intended to be immutable. Code points, on the other hand, may change
    as required to accommodate insertions or deletions of glyphs.

-   New **Notes for implementers** section with expanded guidelines for
    glyph registration, with changes for precomposed stems and stem
