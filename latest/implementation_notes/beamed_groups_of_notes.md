This range is most useful in fonts intended for text-based applications,
with metrics that are compatible for mixing musical symbols with text.

In such a font, these glyphs may be used for displaying complex metric
modulations and *lâ€™istesso tempo* directions in conjunction with the
precomposed note glyphs in the **Individual notes** range.

Kerning pairs for every combination of these glyphs should be included
such that the fractional beams overlap slightly with the stems of notes
and other beams; this helps provide a consistent appearance in a variety
of rendering contexts and at different zoom levels. Special attention
should be given to the kerning pairs including **textAugmentationDot**,
which should be kerned rightwards away from notes and leftwards so that
it lies underneath glyphs showing the middle of beams (e.g.
**textCont8thBeamShortStem**); and to the pairs involving the tuplet
brackets (e.g. **textTupletBracketStartShortStem**), which should be kerned
leftwards such that they are correctly aligned when entered after a note
character.

By way of example:
