The **brace** glyph should have a height of 1em, i.e. the height of a single
five-line stave, and should be scaled proportionally (i.e. in both
dimensions, not only in the vertical dimension) in a scoring application
to the appropriate height of the two or more staves it encompasses.

Font designers may choose to include a number of alternative **brace**
glyphs designed to accommodate larger distances, to avoid the standard
**brace** glyph becoming too wide and bold at larger sizes. (Bravura, for
example, includes four stylistic alternates for **brace**, designed to
encompass numbers of staves from one up to 10 or more.)

**bracket** is a complete bracket of a fixed height useful for displaying
brackets in text-based documents or applications.

To display a bracket of variable height in a scoring application, use
**bracketTop** and **bracketBottom** as the top and bottom terminals of a
bracket drawn using a stroked line or filled rectangle of the
appropriate width.
