Scoring applications may simply use multiple instances of **tremolo1**
imposed on note stems to draw one-note tremolos with different numbers
of slashes.

The fingered tremolo glyphs are for two-note tremolos. Scoring
applications should draw two-note tremolos using the same primitives
used for drawing beams, rather than using these glyphs.
