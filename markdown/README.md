# Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL)

### Version 1.25 (2017-10-25)

SMuFL is a specification that provides a standard way of mapping the thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the Private Use Area in Unicode’s Basic Multilingual Plane for a single (format-independent) font.

The goal of SMuFL is to establish a new standard glyph mapping for musical symbols that is optimised for modern font formats and that can be adopted by a variety of software vendors and font designers, for the benefit of all users of music notation software.

This specification is maintained by the [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/). Please consult that page for further details. The group is chaired by Michael Good, Joe Berkovitz, and Daniel Spreadbury.
