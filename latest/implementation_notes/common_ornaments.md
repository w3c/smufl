Scoring applications should draw grace notes in the same way as they
draw regular notes, rather than using the precomposed glyphs.

Likewise, scoring applications should draw *glissandi* using multiple
instances of a wiggly line segment (e.g. **wiggleGlissando**), not the
precomposed glyphs, to provide variable length and angle.
