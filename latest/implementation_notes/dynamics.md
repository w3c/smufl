Scoring applications should draw *crescendo* and *diminuendo* hairpins
using primitives rather than **dynamicCrescendoHairpin** and
**dynamicDiminuendoHairpin** in order to provide variable width, line
thickness, angle and aperture.

Ligatures should be defined for common combinations of dynamics, such as
<span class="bravura">&#xE52C;</span>. Special attention should be paid to kerning
pairs for these glyphs.

Scoring applications may choose to draw dynamics either using multiple
glyphs (e.g. 3 x **dynamicForte** for <span class="bravura">&#xE530;</span>) or using
the pre-composed glyph (e.g. 1 x **dynamicFFF** for
<span class="bravura">&#xE530;</span>).
