This range provides glyphs for tuplet numbers. These digits may also be
used in ligatures with clefs to indicate the interval by which a
transposing instrument transposes, used in some scores in C.

Scoring applications should use primitives to draw tuplet brackets.

Simple triplets (including brackets) can be written in fonts intended
for use in text-based applications using the glyphs in the **Beamed
groups of notes** range.
