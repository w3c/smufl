The Trojan (or tone-fraction) set is not strictly-speaking an extension
of Athenian, as there are a few Athenians (including Spartans) that are
not Trojan. Those are the glyphs whose descriptions include “5:7k”,
“7:11k”, “5:11S”, “25S” or “11L” and do not include a tone-fraction.

The descriptions below the Sagittal glyphs do not include all possible
uses, only a selection of the most common. To determine which of these
glyphs to use for tone-fractions not listed here (as well as for JI
ratios and degrees of EDOs that are not listed here) please see
<http://sagittal.org>.
