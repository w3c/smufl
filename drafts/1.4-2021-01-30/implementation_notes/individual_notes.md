Precomposed notes in this range may be used for placing notes on a
staff. In fonts intended for text-based applications, these characters
may be set up as ligatures with the control characters in the
**Combining staff positions** range to allow them to be moved up and
down to different positions on a staff (e.g. using characters from the
**Staves** range).

However, scoring applications should draw all notes by combining
notehead glyphs — e.g. **noteheadBlack** for quarter notes (crotchets) and
shorter notes, **noteheadHalf** for half notes (minims) — with stems drawn
using primitives.

It is recommended that the characters in this range should have
full-length stems, i.e. a minimum length of 3.5 spaces.

Characters suitable for mixing with characters from a regular text font,
e.g. as part of a metronome mark, tempo equations, *l’istesso tempo*
marking, etc., are found in the **Metronome marks** range (where it is
recommended that stems should be shortened to provide a more pleasing
balance between the note and the surrounding text characters).
